    <h1>This is a test page</h1>

    <h2>This is another header, number 2!</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph element</p>
    <p>Here you can see my test page which I have to say, I am very proud of.</p>
    <p>Although it's basic, it's my <strong>first</strong> webpage!</p>
    <p>It's just <strong><em>sooo</em></strong> fancy</p>

    <!-- This is a comment that says... I need to do more! -->
    <ul>
        <!-- ul is for unordered lists -->
         <li>Unordered List Item 1</li>
         <li>Unordered List Item 2</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Ordered List Item 1</li>
        <li>Ordered List Item 2</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may be wondering why there is random stuff here. It's actually just me followign the Odin Project and getting used to the elements. You can see the Odin Project yourself in the following link: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Odin Project</a></p>
    <p>The above paragraph contained a link to an absolute path which is an external path, such as the Odin Project website. The following path is an <a href="about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about</a> page that is actually part of this website and stored in the same folder!</p>
    <!-- Link Redirection seems to such within VS Code Live Preview?-->
    <p>Just to make it complicated, this is the about page, stored in the pages folder of our program: <a href="./Pages/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here!</a></p>
