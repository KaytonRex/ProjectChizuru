# Multiverse Projects and KSBs

## Background
Throughout the Multiverse Apprenticeship, you will be working with Projects where you'll be expected to show a certain amount of Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours.

This document is to help aid with the creation of Projects and to ensure that we've not only met KSB standards but also exceed them.

## Assessment Methods
The way you will show the KSBs is through a main work-based project (Assessment Method 1) and through a series of projects within a portfolio (Assessment Method 2). Below is an explaination of each of the assessment methods.

### Assessment Method 1: Work-based Project
AM1 (Project and Presentation, also known as the Work-Based Project): An 8-week project that you work on after you have submitted your portfolio. It is mapped against specific KSBs. Whilst completing the project, you will also have to produce a 3500-word report. On the day of your EPA interview, you will deliver a 20-minute presentation on your project, followed by 20 minutes of questions.

### Assessment Method 2: Portfolio Projects
AM2 (Portfolio and Professional Discussion): This is a single document consisting of 2-10 pieces of evidence from projects. You will have from their Flying start until their Gateway meeting to complete this. It is mapped against specific KSBs. The Professional Discussion occurs after the submission of AM1 and consists of a 60-minute discussion of the portfolio.

## KSBs
KSB stands for Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours. Below will be a list of what criteria must be met to ensure you've reached the standards. However, you do not need to include EVERY KSB in every project, nor do you have to hit every KSB in both Assessment Methods.

Before we go into the Projects, below is a list of the KSBs that are involved in Assessment Method 1 and Assessment Method 2.

### K1 & B1 (AM2) <a name="K1B1"></a>

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K1 + B1  | Explains how current, relevant legislation impacts on the safe use of data and how their role contributes to a productive, safe, and secure working environment | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
The focus of this KSB is understanding the data legislation that you must follow in your role, how it impacts your work and analysis, and the steps you take to proactively maintain a safe and secure working environment. You will need to do both to meet this grading criteria. 

To best showcase this evidence a clear understanding, including definitions of relevant data legislation that affects your role is necessary. It is critical that you highlight GDPR, define it, and how it can impact your work. Any definitions or explanations for legislation should be in your own words. (K1) 

B1 will focus on how you apply K1. You should also share how you maintain a safe and secure working environment. This could be on how you utilize passwords, share information, and even continue certifications you acquire that focus on data legislation. Evidence that also shows instances, where you have successfully circumvented data security-related challenges or enhanced workplace productivity and security, serves as evidence for B1.

#### Marking the Projects
| KSB | Description | Met | Even Better If |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| K1 | Current relevant legislation and its application to the safe use of data | Explains how current, relevant legislation impacts on the safe use of data and how their role contributes to a productive, safe, and secure working environment | Analyze how to align working practices to current, relevant legislation and implement best practices to increase the safety of data projects |
| B1 | Maintain a productive, professional and secure working environment | *See Above* | Create processes and resources to educate others on how to create a productive, safe, and secure working environment |


#### Questions to Ask Yourself to Super-Charge Your Portfolio
Below are questions you can ask yourself to make sure you have fully evidenced K1 and B1:
- Have you demonstrated that you know what GDPR/data protection act is? 
- Can you summarise the 7 principles of GDPR?
- Can you explain what Personal Identifiable Information is (PII)? 
- Can you explain how GDPR impacts on data access and data use in your role and portfolio project?
- How are you working to ensure that you adhere to GDPR/the data protection act?
- How are you working to ensure that you are in line with your organisation’s data policies?
- How do you work with stakeholders to manage their requirements/interests?

### K2 (AM2) <a name="K2"></a>

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K2       | Explains the relevant data policies and procedures for the organisation, and identifies the data standards to be reached | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
Data policies play a vital role in any organisation that deals with data. They provide guidelines and standards on how data should be collected, stored, used, and protected.

Your organisation may follow GDPR but in addition to this you may have an organisational policy that goes beyond the framework focusing on how your business will collect, store, and use data securely. You may also have an organisational policy around AI usage. 

To showcase this evidence when describing the approach you took for a piece of work you can explain any policies that can affect your work and provide a clear example of how that has impacted your work. You can share excerpts from your organisational policies as well.

#### Marking the Projects
| KSB | Description | Met | Even Better If |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| K2 | organisational data and information security standards, policies, and procedures relevant to data management activities | Explain the relevant data policies and procedures for an organisation and identify the data standards to be reached | Create recommendations on how to go beyond the standard within an organisation's data policies. |
