# Multiverse Projects and KSBs

## Background
Throughout the Multiverse Apprenticeship, you will be working with Projects where you'll be expected to show a certain amount of Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours.

This document is to help aid with the creation of Projects and to ensure that we've not only met KSB standards but also exceed them.

## Assessment Methods <a id="AssessmentMethods"></a>
The way you will show the KSBs is through a main work-based project (Assessment Method 1) and through a series of projects within a portfolio (Assessment Method 2). Below is an explaination of each of the assessment methods.

### Assessment Method 1: Work-based Project
AM1 (Project and Presentation, also known as the Work-Based Project): An 8-week project that you work on after you have submitted your portfolio. It is mapped against specific KSBs. Whilst completing the project, you will also have to produce a 3500-word report. On the day of your EPA interview, you will deliver a 20-minute presentation on your project, followed by 20 minutes of questions.

### Assessment Method 2: Portfolio Projects
AM2 (Portfolio and Professional Discussion): This is a single document consisting of 2-10 pieces of evidence from projects. You will have from their Flying start until their Gateway meeting to complete this. It is mapped against specific KSBs. The Professional Discussion occurs after the submission of AM1 and consists of a 60-minute discussion of the portfolio.

## KSBs  <a id="KSBs"></a>
KSB stands for Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours. Below will be a list of what criteria must be met to ensure you've reached the standards. However, you do not need to include EVERY KSB in every project, nor do you have to hit every KSB in both Assessment Methods.

Before we go into the Projects, below is a list of the KSBs that are involved in Assessment Method 1 and Assessment Method 2.

### K1 & B1 (AM2) <a id="K1B1"></a>

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K1 + B1  | Explains how current, relevant legislation impacts on the safe use of data and how their role contributes to a productive, safe, and secure working environment | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
The focus of this KSB is understanding the data legislation that you must follow in your role, how it impacts your work and analysis, and the steps you take to proactively maintain a safe and secure working environment. You will need to do both to meet this grading criteria. 

To best showcase this evidence a clear understanding, including definitions of relevant data legislation that affects your role is necessary. It is critical that you highlight GDPR, define it, and how it can impact your work. Any definitions or explanations for legislation should be in your own words. (K1) 

B1 will focus on how you apply K1. You should also share how you maintain a safe and secure working environment. This could be on how you utilize passwords, share information, and even continue certifications you acquire that focus on data legislation. Evidence that also shows instances, where you have successfully circumvented data security-related challenges or enhanced workplace productivity and security, serves as evidence for B1.

#### Marking the Projects
| KSB | Description | Met | Even Better If |

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K2       | Explains the relevant data policies and procedures for the organisation, and identifies the data standards to be reached | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
Data policies play a vital role in any organisation that deals with data. They provide guidelines and standards on how data should be collected, stored, used, and protected.

Your organisation may follow GDPR but in addition to this you may have an organisational policy that goes beyond the framework focusing on how your business will collect, store, and use data securely. You may also have an organisational policy around AI usage. 

To showcase this evidence when describing the approach you took for a piece of work you can explain any policies that can affect your work and provide a clear example of how that has impacted your work. You can share excerpts from your organisational policies as well.

### K3 + S2 (AM1) <a id="K3S2"></a>

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K3 + S2  | Outlines and applies the principles of data analysis lifecycle to the steps of data analysis | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
Within your report, you should explain each stage of the data analysis lifecycle and how you have applied each within your project. You can use the data analysis lifecycle above or cite a different version of the data analysis lifecycle but it must include Planning, Data preparation, Analysis, Refining and Comparing and Communication and Implementation at a minimum and you must provide evidence of having applied each of the steps. Although modelling isn't a strict requirement, we advise including a model or forecast within your work-based project. If you decide not to, you'll need to ensure the analysis component of your project is substantial and that you explain your interpretation and evaluate the results. 

#### Questions to Ask Yourself to Super-Charge Your Portfolio
Below are questions you can ask yourself to make sure you have fully evidenced K3 and S2:
- Outline and explain what the data analysis life cycle is
- Explain how the data analysis life cycle applies in your project (For example, If your project does not include a machine learning model, you should adapt the stage named modelling - possibly to analysis - to avoid using an incorrect term)
- Explain the steps of the data analysis life cycle that you undertook during your project (you must evidence all steps of the data analysis lifecycle that you present from point 1 here)
- How did you tailor the standard data analysis lifecycle stages to fit your project's unique requirements?
- How does each step of the data analysis life cycle contribute to the overall success of a project?
- Can you provide an example from your project where a specific step in the data analysis life cycle was crucial?
- How would the project outcome differ if one of the steps in the data analysis life cycle was omitted?
- How did you validate the findings from your analysis against the project objectives?

### K4 (AM1) <a id="K4"></a>

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K4       | Describe the principles of data including open, public, administrative and research data and how they relate to the data used within the project | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
In your project write-up when explaining your data you will need to state if your data is administrative, research, open, or public. Even if in the project you do not use one of the types of data you should still define it and explain why you didn’t use it. 

For example, you may only need to use administrative data in your project. You should still explain what is open, public, or research data and why you would not use it in the analysis. 

It is possible to evidence S3 at the same time as K4 if you are discussing in detail your data as well. 

#### Questions to Ask Yourself to Super-Charge Your Portfolio
Below are questions you can ask yourself to make sure you have fully evidenced K4:
- Define the different types of data (open data, public data, administrative data, and research data)

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
You should be able to explain your data, taking into account its structure, how that impacts the decisions you make in your analysis, and any risks you have to mitigate because of the structure. 

When explaining your data it is important to show an understanding of both structured and unstructured data. Even if your evidence is only one type of structure, you need to explain why it is not the other type of structure. For example, the data you work with in a SQL database is structured. You define what structured data is and then explain how you know this data is structured. You should then define what unstructured data is and then why your data is not unstructured.  You should be able to describe examples of both types of data.

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
When you explain the data you use for analysis, you should be able to explain what kind of database the data comes from, how this affects how you access your data. For example, if you use a relational database or NoSQL you should be able to define the database structure, how it is stored in those areas, and how you access the data there. 

In your introduction when you explain your business this is a great time to provide details on your organization’s database. Creating an ERD is also a great way to show your understanding of your data.

| Standard | Grading Criteria | Distinction |
|:---------|:-----------------|:------------|
| K7       | Explains the principles of user experience and domain context for data analytics. | N/A |

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
User experience and domain context can affect your analysis approach and the outputs you create. When you are explaining your analytical approach and why you took the steps you did, the user experience should also be considered. 

As a note, user experience is not just a customer but any end user who will work with the deliverables you create. This could be your manager using a dashboard you created or another team using a dataset that you cleaned. 

A great way to evidence K7 is explaining the choices you made for a visualisation or a dashboard.

K7 can also easily be evidence with S5, which is a standard that focuses on the application of UX in a project.

#### Portfolio Evidence Requirements
Your portfolio should show examples of both descriptive and inferential statistics. Although the standard does not state hypothesis testing explicitly, having it in a piece of evidence is a great way to demonstrate application of inferential statistics. In the context of the portfolio, inferential testing should be considered from the perspective of the business e.g. is there a statistically significant relationship/difference between variables or groups?

It is critical that no matter what type of statistics are evidenced you must be able to explain it and its related metrics. This means providing a basic definition, why you used it in your analysis, why you used it over other methods, and how it benefited your end results. You need to include this explanation in the portfolio and be able to verbally explain this in your interview.
