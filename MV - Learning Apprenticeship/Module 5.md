## Overview  <a name="overview"></a>
Unfortunately, we do not always use our data to the best of it's ability and as a result, Gartner has estimated that companies lose on average $12.9m per year due to poor quality.

By insisting on using individual sources, we lose valuable additional context, resulting in insights being reduced.

When we combine our data sources together within the data integration processes, we can build a better picture which leads to more meaningful insight and therefore a better ability to produce recommendations and create business decisions that result in growth.

This module is broken down into two units to help guide you with this.

## Unit 1: Database Design <a name="unit1"></a>
During this unit, we wiull explore different ways organisations store their data and the tools/methods we can utilise to access the data required for projects.

This unit is broken down into three sections:
* [Database Design & Data Structures](#unit1-1)
* [Database Management Systems](#unit1-2)
* [Normalization](#unit1-3)

The KSBs that will need to be covered in this unit are as below:
* **K6**: Describe the fundamentals of data structures and database system design and explain how they are implemented and maintained.
* **S4**: Analyze data sets taking account of different data structures and database designs.
